Intro
=====

So, the SOPA emergency list[0] is going to be fairly broken when
IP addresses change. Also, pastebin[1] and other centralized systems,
such as Google Docs[2], opens the door to single points of 
failure. Git or some other DVCS is the only way to make something 
like this scale to what's needed.


No instructions here
====================

This repo should be used by people who already know what to do with
its contents. Among other things, there are large security risks
involved with directing Internet traffic. I don't want to be liable
for someone being reliant on the information in here. So, I wont 
accept any pull requests for people providing instructions on how
to use a hosts file.

That said, if you would like to create useful service on the basis 
of the information in here - you should do so.


Neither authoritative nor trustworthy
=====================================

Unless the DNS system is broken by SOPA or some other system, do
not use this. There is a chance that  you will be infected by malicious 
people who direct your computer to the wrong place.

While DNS is still running, you can actually update the hosts
file yourself.


Contributing
============

These commands provide some guidance on how to contribute data:

    $ echo "http://en.wikipedia.org" >> new
    $ cat new | python bin/urls2hosts | sort -n - hosts | uniq > hosts
    $ awk '{print $2, $1}' hosts | sort > stsoh
    $ git add hosts stsoh
    $ git commit
